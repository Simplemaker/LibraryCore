# LibraryCore

An open source game engine for RP dice games, inspired by Library of Ruina. 

### Objectives

This project aims to provide a platform for creating stories with dice-based strategy
combat. This will include the use of custom cards, characters, dialogue, and assets.

### Dice Combat

In each scene, players and enemies will choose a card containing dice and a target. At
combat start, each card's dice will be rolled, and ordered according to the character's 
speed roll.

Dice with higher speed will be used first. Dice will clash with the highest speed dice
of the targeted opponent, if any exist. Each die can only be used once.
